<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following loglevels were omitted in this report: SKIP, INFO, PASS, DEBUG</p>

    <p>Meaning of check results:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>💥 An <em>ERROR</em> is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    <li>🔥 A <em>FAIL</em> is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    <li>⚠️ A <em>WARN</em> is something that you should consider addressing.
    <li>ℹ️ An <em>INFO</em> result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    <li>✅ A <em>PASS</em> means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
    <li>⏩ And a <em>SKIP</em> happens when the check does not apply to the given font.
    </ul>

    <p>If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at our
        <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues">issue tracker.</a></p>

The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.</p>

The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.</p>

On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.
